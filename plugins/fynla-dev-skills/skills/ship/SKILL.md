# Ship — Atomic Git Pipeline

One command to commit, push, and optionally create a PR or merge. Eliminates the repetitive "commit this, push it, create a PR, merge it" workflow.

## Step 1: Assess Current State

```bash
git status
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git diff --stat HEAD
git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null
git diff --name-only --cached 2>/dev/null
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard 2>/dev/null
```

If there are no changes (staged, unstaged, or untracked), check if there are unpushed commits:

```bash
git log origin/$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null
```

If nothing to commit AND nothing to push, tell the user and stop.

## Step 2: Stage Files

Stage all relevant files. **Exclude** sensitive and generated files:

**Always exclude:**
- `.env`, `.env.production`, `.env.local`
- `credentials.json`, `*.key`, `*.pem`
- `node_modules/`, `vendor/`
- `storage/logs/`
- `public/hot`

**Stage by reading the changed files:**

```bash
# Stage modified and new files (but not deleted)
git add [specific files]
```

Prefer adding specific files by name. Only use `git add -A` if the user explicitly asks for it.

If there are files the user likely does NOT want committed (temp files, debug logs, large binaries), flag them before staging:

> "I see these files — should I include them?"
> - `tech-debt-report.md` (generated report)
> - `storage/logs/laravel.log` (log file)

## Step 3: Generate Commit Message

Analyse all staged changes and draft a commit message:

**Rules:**
- Use conventional commit format: `type: description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- If changes span multiple types, use the dominant one
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add a body (2-3 sentences) if the change is substantial
- End with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

**Examples:**
```
feat: add pension contribution optimiser with tax relief calculator
fix: correct IHT calculation for married couples with RNRB taper
docs: update CLAUDE.md metrics and add session management skills
refactor: extract coverage gap logic into dedicated analyser service
style: apply pint formatting to estate module services
```

**For multi-scope changes:**
```
feat: implement protection plan with coverage gap analysis and recommendations

Add ProtectionPlanBuilder service generating per-policy recommendations,
coverage gap visualisation, and what-if scenarios. Includes action
definitions seeder and admin-configurable thresholds.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Step 4: Commit

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[generated commit message]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

If the commit fails due to pre-commit hooks (e.g., pint formatting), fix the issue and create a NEW commit (never `--amend`).

## Step 5: Push

Determine if the branch tracks a remote:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null
```

If no upstream, push with `-u`:
```bash
git push -u origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
```

If upstream exists:
```bash
git push
```

## Step 6: Create PR (if applicable)

**When to create a PR:**
- If the current branch is NOT `main` — always offer to create a PR
- If the user said "PR", "pull request", or "ship and PR"
- If the user said "push pr and merge" — create PR AND merge

**When to skip PR:**
- If on `main` and the user just said "ship" or "commit and push"
- If the user explicitly said "no PR"

**PR creation:**

```bash
gh pr create --title "[PR title]" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- [1-3 bullet points from commit analysis]

## Changed Files
- [count] PHP files
- [count] Vue components
- [count] other files

## Test Plan
- [ ] Run `./vendor/bin/pest` — all tests pass
- [ ] Verify on localhost with preview persona
- [ ] Check changed feature works as expected

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
EOF
)"
```

**PR title rules:**
- Under 70 characters
- Matches the commit message type + description
- No period at the end

## Step 7: Merge (if requested)

Only merge if the user explicitly asked (e.g., "push pr and merge", "ship and merge", "merge it").

```bash
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
```

After merge, switch back to main and pull:
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
```

## Step 8: Report

Show what was done:

```
## Shipped

**Commit:** [hash] [message]
**Branch:** [branch name]
**Pushed:** origin/[branch]
**PR:** [URL] (if created)
**Merged:** Yes/No

**Files shipped:**
- [count] PHP, [count] Vue, [count] other
```

## Quick Modes

The user may invoke with shorthand. Handle these patterns:

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "ship" | Commit + push (PR if not on main) |
| "ship it" | Same as "ship" |
| "commit and push" | Commit + push only, no PR |
| "push" | Push only (no new commit if clean) |
| "push and PR" | Push + create PR |
| "push pr and merge" | Push + create PR + merge + switch to main |
| "ship and merge" | Commit + push + PR + merge |
| "just commit" | Commit only, no push |

## Important

- NEVER force push (`--force`) unless the user explicitly requests it
- NEVER amend existing commits — always create new ones
- NEVER skip hooks (`--no-verify`) unless the user explicitly requests it
- NEVER push to main without confirming if there's a branch protection bypass warning
- NEVER commit `.env`, credentials, or secrets — warn and exclude
- ALWAYS use HEREDOC format for commit messages (ensures proper formatting)
- ALWAYS show the commit message to the user before committing if there are >10 changed files
- If on main and there are substantial changes, suggest creating a feature branch first
